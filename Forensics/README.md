# Digital Forensics
Usually organizer will gave us a Digital Image like memory dump like .raw or image file like .e01 and few others more.
Always issuing file <filename> command to whatever file you get first! If the result of the file command is only "data", you must try harder to find the right tool to carve information that contain in the file.
Checkout the EXIF data of the file by using exiftool <filename> command.
Run strings for clues.
Try file carve using foremost <filename>  command. Foremost support all files. But it takes time to extract all file when you face a big size file.
Common locations for various artifacts :-
